# modbot
A meta-bot of sorts for my personal discord.
Set up as several sub-modules or Add-ins, each doing a specific action. This is done so I don't need to write a new bot for every mini-project.

Additional modules can be added by sub-classing DispatchedBot, and added in main.
If you want to use this, you need to define a key.txt and a users.txt.
